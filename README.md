# State-Space models (SSMs)

* **Stochastic Lorenz 96 model** (available in Matlab, and Python) . This model is described by two types of state variables: slow-changing variables, $x$, and fast-changing 
  variables, $z$. Both types of variables are coupled. Their ODEs (for simplicity we show the deterministic version here) 
  are described by
  
  $$dx = $$
 
  $$dz =  $$

  We used this implementation for 
  

* **Stochastic Lorenz 63 model**.
