# Lorenz models

* **Stochastic Lorenz 96 model** (available in Matlab, and Python) . This model has two different versions: (1) the mono-scale model, and (2) the multi-scale model. 
    
  * The multi-scale model has two state variables, $x$ and $z$, of dimensions $d_x$ and $d_z$ respectively. 
  While $x$ is a slow-changing variable, $z$ evolves fast in time. It also has four static parameters $F$, $H$, $C$ and $B$. 
  * The mono-scale model is a simpler version of the previous one, ignoring the variable $z$ and the influence it has in $x$. The number of 
  static parameters are also reduced, and there is only $F$.

  The dimension of the model can be tuned, making it interesting to try algorithms and methodologies in higher dimensions.

  
* **Stochastic Lorenz 63 model** (available in Matlab and Python). This is a 3-dimensional chaotic model, described by the SDEs:
    
    $$dx_1 = -S (x_1 - x_2) + \sigma dw_1,$$

    $$dx_2 = R x_1 - x_2 - x_1 x_3 + \sigma dw_2,$$

    $$dx_3 = x_1 x_2 - B x_3 + \sigma dw_3,$$
    
    where the $w_i$'s are independent 1-dimensional Wiener processes, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the state noise,
    and $S$, $R$, and $B$ are static parameters.
