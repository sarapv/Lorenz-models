# State-Space models (SSMs)

* **Stochastic Lorenz 96 model** (available in Matlab, and Python) . This model is described by two types of state 
    variables: $d_x$-dimensional slow-changing variables, $\boldsymbol{x}$, and $d_z$-dimensional fast-changing 
    variables, $\boldsymbol{z}$. Both types of variables are coupled. Their SDEs are described by
  
    $$d\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{f}_x (\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{z}) dt + \sigma_x d\boldsymbol{w}_x,$$
 
    $$d\boldsymbol{z} =  \boldsymbol{f}_z (\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{z}) dt + \sigma_z d\boldsymbol{w}_z,$$

 where the elements of each function, $\boldsymbol{f}_x$ and $\boldsymbol{f}_z$, at a specific time step are

  $$f_{x,j} (\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{z}) = - x_{j-1} (x_{j-2} - x_{j+1}) - x_j + F - \frac{HC}{B} \sum_{l=(j-1)L}^{Lj-1} z_l,$$

  $$f_{z,l} (\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{z}) = -C B z_{l+1} (z_{l+2} - z_{l-1}) - C z_l + \frac{CF}{B} + \frac{HC}{B} x_{\lfloor \frac{l-1}{L} \rfloor}.$$

  Here, $F$, $H$, $C$ and $B$ are static parameters. The dynamic variables are assumed to be arranged on a circular structure.
  We used Euler integration to obtain a discrete-time version of the model (with integration step $h$).
